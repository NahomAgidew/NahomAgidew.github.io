The [**Metaverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) is a collection of 3D worlds that simulate and support the current Internet infrastructure that we have such as *payments*, *social media*, and *gaming*. It is supposed to be experienced in real-time just like how we experience the 2-dimensional Internet world right now. The Metaverse just extends those features into a virtual world where we can fully immerse ourselves.

## Introduction
Directly quoting Matthewball, a venture capitalist in tech, he defines the Metaverse as follows:
> “The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”

## Components
The following are components of the Metaverse that need to work together in order to bring this technology into reality.
### Hardware
First, we need enterprise hardware used to create these virtual worlds. A good example is the hardware that Hollywood studios use to create scenes using cameras, object tracking systems and sensors). We also need consumer-facing hardware such as VR headsets, mobile phones, and haptic gloves to read in the virtual worlds.
### Networking
The current Internet network infrastructure (TCP/IP and its layers) need to support a significantly higher number of real-time connections and more data (since the file sizes will be large).
### Compute
The ability to perform physics calculation, rendering, syncing, as well as AI.
### Interchange Tools and Standards
There needs interoperability in this new technology. For example, no one company owns the Internet, instead, we have a open standards that anyone can use to build websites and join the global network. Similarly, we need to create a similar standard for the Metaverse. For instance, Amazon can build a "shopping world" and make it available to everyone just like their [website](https://www.amazon.com) is available to anyone with an Internet device, yet Amazon doesn't "own" the Internet.
### Payments
Digital Payments are a critical component of the Metaverse. The vision here is to have a mature crypto network advanced enough to support as many transactions as Visa's and Mastercard's network.
### Metaverse Content, Services, and Assets
This equivalent to the [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_US&gl=US). Those two sites provide a seamless way to access apps/"experiences". There should be a similar platform for the Metaverse as well so users can jump from world to world seamlessly.
